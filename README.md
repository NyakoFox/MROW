# MROW (My Rewritten Overworlds)

MROW is an overworld engine for the [Create Your Frisk](https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk/) Undertale battle engine, written INSIDE of a battle. This means you can create maps using [Tiled](https://mapeditor.org/) and Lua, instead of having to download Unity!

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to read the **usage section** of this README before attempting to use MROW.

## Usage

To use this library, **download the repository** and place it in **the root directory** of your mod.

MROW is unfinished, so there's no usage instructions yet, sorry!
